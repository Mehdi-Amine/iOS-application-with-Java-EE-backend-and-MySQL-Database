# iOS-application-with-Java-EE-backend-and-MySQL-Database
An application that aims to facilitate interaction between business owners and customers
A work in progress that started as a capstone project.
I want to use this project to learn and experiment and push my limits as a full-stack developer.
In this project I implemented a backend using Java EE and exposed it as a RESTful web-service to my iOS interface.
I integrated the phone camera, GPS, the native iOS calendar app, Apple Push Notificayion Services, Google Maps API, 
and so much more in one project.


In the video demo (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2-U3RQI8OUEUEtKTVFGUmx5WEU), I am showing a use case where: 

1- I enter the application as a business owner

2- I create my business and enter information conscerning its category, address, phone, and a picture

3- Then I submit all the information and exit the app

4- Then I show the Http requests being sent from my phone to my backend, displaying the transfer of data that was just created

5- I open the app again and this time enter as a customer looking for the service of a business owner

6- I demonstrate that I can search by categories

7- I also demonstrate that the results of my search are sorted by proximity and by rating

8- I can then request the service I choose by submitting a request or by calling directly by tapping on the phone number

9- I can follow the status of my requests (pending/confirmed/achieved) 

10- I can also evaluate the quality of the service after its achievement

I haven't finished this project yet, but I am very proud of the amount of work I have achieved on my own 
and everything I learned along the way
